This is my dotfiles.
- tmux
- zsh
- git


## Make the default shell (the latest) zsh
- ``.bash_profile.sample`` is for the environment where users can't use ``chsh`` and the login shell is bash.
- ``.zshenv.sample`` is for the environment where users need to set proxy variables

## Instruction for the client desktop and laptop PCs (debian+gnome3)
- Register ``mysshagent.sh`` in ``.zsh`` folder to ``gnome-session-properties``
    - The file generated by ``gnome-keyring-daemon`` has the environment variable ``SSH_AUTH_SOCK``
    - ``zshrc.envvar`` uses this variable to user the socket in shells in the ``screen``
